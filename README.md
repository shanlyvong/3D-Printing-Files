# 3D Printing Files

I started to self-teach myself 3D printing around 4-5 years ago because I thought it looked cool. Eventually, I realized how fun and exciting it was to design and make something from scratch! 

Even though a lot of these designs are elementary and for novelty-sakes, it brings me a lot of joy and I was able to learn a lot about 3D printing. However, I do intend to apply what I already know about 3D printing to create on a more practical and academic scale and expand my pre-existing knowledge.
